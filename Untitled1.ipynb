        "# Explanation of the modified code:\n",
        "\n",
        "# The modified `is_armstrong_number` function improves upon the original by avoiding the conversion of the input number to a string.\n",
        "# The original approach of converting to a string to iterate through digits can introduce overhead, especially for very large numbers,\n",
        "# due to the memory allocation and manipulation involved in string operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "# The modified code uses mathematical operations to extract digits, which is generally more performant for numerical tasks.\n",
        "# Here's how the modified code works:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Handling negative numbers:\n",
        "# The code first checks if the input `number` is negative. Armstrong numbers are typically defined for non-negative integers,\n",
        "# so it immediately returns `False` for negative inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Counting the number of digits:\n",
        "# Instead of using `len(str(number))`, the code uses a `while` loop and integer division (`// 10`) to count the digits.\n",
        "# A temporary variable `temp_number` is initialized with the input `number`.\n",
        "# The loop continues as long as `temp_number` is greater than 0.\n",
        "# In each iteration, `temp_number` is divided by 10 using integer division, effectively removing the last digit.\n",
        "# The `num_digits` counter is incremented in each iteration until `temp_number` becomes 0, at which point `num_digits` holds the total number of digits.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Calculating the sum of digits raised to the power of the number of digits:\n",
        "# The `temp_number` is reset to the original `number`.\n",
        "# A second `while` loop is used to iterate through the digits again, this time to calculate the sum of the digits raised to the power of `num_digits`.\n",
        "# In each iteration:\n",
        "#    - `digit = temp_number % 10` extracts the last digit using the modulo operator (`%`).\n",
        "#    - `armstrong_sum += digit ** num_digits` calculates the digit raised to the power of `num_digits` and adds it to the `armstrong_sum`.\n",
        "#    - `temp_number //= 10` removes the last digit using integer division.\n",
        "# The loop continues until `temp_number` becomes 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Comparing the sum with the original number:\n",
        "# Finally, the calculated `armstrong_sum` is compared with the `original_number` to determine if it's an Armstrong number.\n",
        "# The function returns `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Structural improvements:\n",
        "# While the code is slightly longer due to the separate loops for counting digits and calculating the sum,\n",
        "# this approach is arguably more structured for numerical processing as it directly manipulates the number using mathematical operations\n",
        "# rather than relying on string conversions, which can be seen as an indirect way to handle numerical digits.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Performance improvements:\n",
        "# Avoiding string conversion eliminates the overhead associated with creating and manipulating string objects.\n",
        "# Mathematical operations on integers are typically faster and require less memory compared to string operations,\n",
        "# especially for large numbers. This can lead to better performance, although the difference might be negligible for smaller numbers."
