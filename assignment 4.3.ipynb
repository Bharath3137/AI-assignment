        "This code cell provides a function to read a text file and count its lines.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Dummy File Creation:** The first part of the code (`file_content = ...` and `with open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as f: ...`) creates a simple text file named \"example.txt\" with four lines for demonstration purposes.\n",
        "2.  **`def count_lines_in_file(filename):`**: This defines the function `count_lines_in_file` that takes one argument, `filename` (the path to the text file).\n",
        "3.  **`try...except FileNotFoundError`**: This block handles potential errors. If the file specified by `filename` is not found, it prints an error message and returns -1.\n",
        "4.  **`with open(filename, 'r') as f:`**: This opens the file in read mode (`'r'`). The `with` statement ensures the file is automatically closed even if errors occur.\n",
        "5.  **`lines = f.readlines()`**: This reads all lines from the opened file and stores them as a list of strings in the `lines` variable.\n",
        "6.  **`return len(lines)`**: The function returns the number of elements in the `lines` list, which corresponds to the total number of lines in the file.\n",
        "7.  **Example Usage:** The code then demonstrates how to use the function with the created \"example.txt\" and also shows what happens when you try to use it with a file that doesn't exist."
